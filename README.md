- I am a FullStack Software Engineer and my main skills are:
  - Java (Spring Boot, Quarkus, Java EE...)
  - Go
  - Python
  - React.js
  - Node.js
  - Flutter
  - SQL
  - NoSQL (Mostly MongoDB, but I've worked with firestore.)

  - Gitlab pipelines

- I am passionate about learning. I like to spend hours learning things, from how a Stream works in the JVM to how a complete OS works, so if you're in the same mood let's talk :).
